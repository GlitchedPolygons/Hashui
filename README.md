# Hashui

## Bless you!

This is a Qt GUI for quickly generating all kinds of hash strings/message digests based on a text input.

* CRC8, CRC32 and FNV-1a outputs are represented as their integer number (decimal) value.
* The others are hex-encoded strings of their MD output bytes.

Tested on Windows 10. Probably works on other platforms too, dunno.
